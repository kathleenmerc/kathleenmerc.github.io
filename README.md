This is my version of the classic Helicopter Game.
It will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The object of the game is to fly the helicopter without crashing into obstacles along the path.
The game will be controlled using a mouse click + hold/release function.
It can be played by 1 or 2 players, and each player will score points based on the distance they can fly the helicopter without crashing.
Each player will have a certain number of lives, and once all lives are used up, the player with the highest score wins.
